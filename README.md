<h1>KGM LookUp</h1>
My very-own implementation of <a href="https://github.com/Devorkk"> @Devorkk's</a> kogama profile look-up.

No, this is not finished. As of today being `8th September 2024` Only *WWW* look up works.

Will this be updated? God knows, I have better things in mind to focus on.

This was just a basic project for which showcase you can find <a href="https://youtu.be/7RPJdAWTzSs">here</a>.
